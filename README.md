# Edge.SRGAN
This repository was created in order to participate in the Hackathon organized by @SpainAI, in the computer vision challenge. The objective of this challenge was the generation of high resolution images, i.e. Single Image Super Resolution (SISR). For this, I decided to implement a solution that unifies the advantages offered by SRGAN (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) together with those offered by the edge prediction (Edge Informed SISR) introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05305.
